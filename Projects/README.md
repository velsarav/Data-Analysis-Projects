# Projects - Self Driving Car Nanodegree
---

## Title: Programming an Autonomous Vehicle
This is the final [Capstone Project](https://github.com/velsarav/capstone-carla) in Self-Driving
Car Engineer Nanodegree.

Write [ROS nodes](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes) to implement core functionality of the autonomous vehicle system, including traffic light detection, control and waypoint following.

The repo is private.

## Title: PID Controller

Implement a [PID controller](https://github.com/velsarav/pid-controller) in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!

## Title: Highway Driving

Design a [path planner](https://github.com/velsarav/Highway-Driving) that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3-lane highway with traffic.

## Title: Kidnapped Vehicle

The goal of this project is to implement a 2-dimensional [particle filter in C++](https://github.com/velsarav/Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project) to identify the location of the robot using GPS estimate, map of the location, sensor and control data.

## Title: Extended Kalman Filter

Utilize a [Kalman filter](https://github.com/velsarav/project-extended-kalman-filter) to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy LIDAR and RADAR measurements in C++

## Title: Behavioral Cloning

Simulate the autonomous car and train it using [convolutional neural network](https://github.com/velsarav/behavioral-cloning) so that it drives successfully around the track

## Title: Traffic Sign classifier

Classify various traffic signs using [Deep Learning](https://github.com/velsarav/Traffic-Sign-Classifier)

## Title: Advanced Lane Finding

Software pipeline to [identify the lane boundaries](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/tree/master/Projects/Advanced%20Lane%20Finding) in a video from a front-facing camera on a car

## Title: Finding Lane Lines on the Road

Detect the [lane lines in road image and video stream](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/tree/master/Projects/Finding%20Lane%20Lines) using Python

## Projects - Data Analytics Nanodegree

## Title: Create a Tableau Story
[Air Quality Index](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Projects/Create%20a%20Tableau%20Story/A_story_about_Air_Quality_in_Europe_N_Saravanan.pdf) in Europe

## Title: Wrangle and Analyze Data
Data [collection and cleaning](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Projects/Wrangle%20and%20Analyze%20Data/Jupyter_Notebook/wrangle_act.ipynb) using Python

Data [Analysis and Insights](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Projects/Wrangle%20and%20Analyze%20Data/Jupyter_Notebook/act_report.ipynb) using Python

## Title: Explore and Summarize Data
[States Pollution Index in 2017](http://rpubs.com/velsarav/389546) using R

## Title: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
[Analyzing the Stroop Effect](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Projects/Test%20a%20Perceptual%20Phenomenon/Test_a_Perceptual_Phenomenon_N_Saravanan.pdf)
