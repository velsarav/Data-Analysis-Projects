## Fundamentals of Scalable Data Science
As part of the learning journey, the dataset was generated using [NodeRED device simulation](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/NodeRED_Simulation.json) and the MQTT based messages were stored in ApacheCouchDB (Cloudant)

### Title: [Data Visualization](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/DataVisualization.ipynb)

## Advanced Machine Learning and Signal Processing 
Learned about the Jenkin based deployment mechanism for 
1) [NodeRED and Vibration capture App](https://github.com/romeokienzler/discover-iot-sample)
2) [Store the data in ApacheCouchDB (Cloudant)](https://github.com/romeokienzler/iot-platform-bluemix-starter)

### Title: [Data Classification](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/Classification.ipynb)
Classify the dataset generated by smartphone accelarometer.

### Title: [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/Unsupervised%20Learning.ipynb)
Predict the different movement of smartphone accelerometer dataset using clustering algorithm.  

### Title: [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/Feature%20Engineering.ipynb)
Feature engineering improves the prediction model performance.

## Applied AI with DeepLearning  
Simulate the device using NodeRED App which triggers the messages using MQTT

### Title: [Building and serialising Keras models](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/Keras.ipynb)
Create a Keras model by loading a dataset, preporcessing input data, building a Sequential Keras model and compiling the model with a training configuration. Train the model on the training data and evaluate it on the test set.

### Title: [Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/AnomalyDetection.ipynb)
Train the neural network from healthy and broken samples and at later stage hook it up to a message queue for real-time anomaly detection.

### Title: [Apache SystemML](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/SystemML.ipynb)
Scale linear algebra operations from a single machine to multiple machines, memory and CPU cores using Apache SystemML.
Note: This will help to go understand the behind the scenes excution in Keras.
