## Advanced Machine Learning and Signal Processing  
### Title: [Data Classification](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/Classification.ipynb)
Classify the dataset generated by smartphone accelarometer.

### Title: [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/Unsupervised%20Learning.ipynb)
Predict the different movement of smartphone accelerometer dataset using clustering algorithm.  

### Title: [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/Feature%20Engineering.ipynb)
Feature engineering improves the prediction model performance.

## Applied AI with DeepLearning  
### [Building and serialising Keras models](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/Keras.ipynb)
Create a Keras model by loading a dataset, preporcessing input data, building a Sequential Keras model and compiling the model with a training configuration. Train the model on the training data and evaluate it on the test set.

### [Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/AnomalyDetection.ipynb)
Train the neural network from healthy and broken samples and at later stage hook it up to a message queue for real-time anomaly detection.

### [Apache SystemML](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Assignments/Python/SystemML.ipynb)
Scale linear algebra operations from a single machine to multiple machines, memory and CPU cores using Apache SystemML.
Note: This will help to go understand the behind the scenes excution in Keras.
