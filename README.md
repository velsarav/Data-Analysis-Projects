# Data-Science:
Started to learn about data science by completing [Data Scientist Python Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python)

Further enhanced by doing projects under [Data Analyst Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

My curiosity leads to accomplish the following courses
* [Fundamentals of scalable data science](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/8e79cfb3-cffd-435d-af09-6747cc39c412/public_url)
* [Advanced Machine Learning and Signal Processing](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/3b2e30af-6171-468e-af44-a06fccaa29ef/linked_in_profile)
* [Applied AI with DeepLearning](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/cd39a2c3-64c2-4f5d-a68e-f61fc2aa2fa8/linked_in_profile).

After completing the  prerequisites course Data Analyst Nanodegree, currently pursuing the first term in [Self Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://github.com/velsarav/Data-Science/blob/master/Projects/Self_Driving_Car.png)


Some of the interesting assignments and projects in my learning journey was captured here.
