# Data-Science:
Started to learn about data science by completing [Data Scientist Python Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python), further enhanced by doing projects under [Data Analyst Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). Currently learning about [Advanced Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-data-science-ibm). 

Some of the interesting assignments and projects in my learning journey was captured here.
